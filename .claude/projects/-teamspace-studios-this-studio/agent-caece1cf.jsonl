The recent commits suggest ongoing work on the codebase with documentation improvements.\n\nWould you like me to explore any specific aspect of the codebase in more detail or help you with a particular search task?"}],"model":"glm-4.6","stop_reason":"end_turn","usage":{"input_tokens":558,"output_tokens":605}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"453ddfd3-f7ed-4cc9-86f9-aecaf72463fc","timestamp":"2025-11-08T19:05:26.938Z"}
